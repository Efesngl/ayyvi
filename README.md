# AYYVI

I made this project for my last year project at school. Written in Laravel 11 and Inertia (Vue.js 3).


## Run Locally

- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Efesngl/ayyvi.git
```

```bash
  cd ayyvi
```
- Copy .env.example file and rename the copy to .env

- Install dependencies

```bash
  composer install
  npm install
  npm run build
```

- Start the server

```bash
  php artisan serve
```
